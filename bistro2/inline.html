<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.<em>To reserve a seat at the chef's table, contact us before <time datetime="20162230">November 30</time>.</em></p>
